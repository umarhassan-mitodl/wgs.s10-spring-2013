*   Attendance and active participation—our class meetings will be devoted primarily to discussion, so everyone's informed contributions are vital.
*   Two 4–5 page papers on the assigned reading, one before Spring break.
*   One paper proposal.
*   One 8–10 page final paper, in draft and final form.
*   One presentation to the class about the final paper.

I will meet with students individually to refine paper topics and to go over drafts.
